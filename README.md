# Eat-That-Burger

## Overview

Eat that Burger is a restaurant app that lets users input the names of burgers they'd like to eat and keep track of the ones that they have already eaten. 

## Description

In this app a user has the ability to input the name of a burger that they will like to eat. When the user submits the burger's name, the app will display the burger on the left side of the page -- waiting to be devoured. Each burger in the waiting area also has a `Devour it!` button. When the user clicks it, the burger moves to the right side of the page. This information is stored in a database.
